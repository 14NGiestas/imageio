Welcome to imageio's documentation!
===================================

imageio is a library that aims to support reading and writing a wide range
of image data, including animated images. It is written in pure 
Python (2.x and 3.x) and most functionality is obtained by wrapping 
the FreeImage library using ctypes. imageio is intended as a replacement for PIL.

imageio is currently in development. We invite anyone who's interested to join the 
discussions.
